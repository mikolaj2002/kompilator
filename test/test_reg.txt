# register e, f, g, h are barely used
# e is used only for multiplication
# f, g are used only for division and modulo
# each line of code uses unique set of registers
# h is always free and and last used variable can be stored in there
# OPTION 1: optimize use of registers in *, /, % and reserve last 2/3 registers for stroring there recetly used variables
# OPTION 2: use as many registers as possible to store recently used variables and when reg shall be used put it back to memory (FIFO)
